# Deep learning models for punch classification in karate  

This repository contains dataset with acceleration sensors measurements and punch classes.  

`wrist_classification/Reproduce_Results.ipynb` - reproducing classification metric results for article 'Recognition punches in karate using acceleration sensors and convolution neural networks. IEEE Access.  10.1109/ACCESS.2021.3118038'.  
 
 `MoveNet.ipynb` - keypoint extractioin for punch videos. Starting videos availiable [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1UwZPZ7sqkmQrqbCP1ypquv2UHWkk0bj-?usp=sharing).  
 
 TODO:
 - Extract keypoints frame by frame to json files.
 - Add some non-linear features, e.g. angles, distances e.t.c.
 - Label frames to several classes: jab, cross, left hook, right hook, left appercot, right appercot.
 - Experiment with sequentions to punch classification.
